# sentiments CS50/pset6

Sentiments is a program that categorizes a word (or a user's tweet in Twitter) 
as positive, negative or neutral and then generates a pie chart 
categorizing a userâ€™s tweets.

This is one of the first tasks made with Python. To implement it I had to figure out
what are Flask and API (Twitter API particularly) and how to use libraries (nltk for this task).

I had some distribution code but I fully implemented following functions:

- __init__ in analyzer.py;
- analyze in analyzer.py;
- main in tweets;
- search in application.py;
